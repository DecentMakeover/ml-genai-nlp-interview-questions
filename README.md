Machine Learning (Supervised, Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning)
Conceptual & Theoretical Questions

Supervised vs. Unsupervised vs. Reinforcement Learning: What are the key differences?

Supervised learning uses labeled data (with known targets) to train models.

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning by interacting with an environment via rewards and penalties.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff.

This is the balance between a model’s bias (error from wrong assumptions, causing underfitting) and its variance (sensitivity to fluctuations in training data, causing overfitting). A good model finds a balance to minimize both.

Overfitting and Prevention: What is overfitting, and how can it be prevented?

Overfitting occurs when a model memorizes training data and fails to generalize to new data. Prevention techniques include cross-validation, regularization (e.g., L1/L2 penalties), reducing model complexity, and using more training data or data augmentation.

Evaluation Metrics (Classification): What is a confusion matrix, and how is it used?

A confusion matrix is a table summarizing model predictions vs. actuals, with entries for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It is used to compute metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess classifier performance.

Precision vs. Recall: When would you favor precision over recall?

Favor precision when the cost of false positives is high (e.g., spam detection). Favor recall when the cost of false negatives is high (e.g., cancer detection).

Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Models: What is the difference?

Parametric models assume a fixed number of parameters and a specific functional form (e.g., linear regression).

Non-parametric models make no strong assumptions and can grow in complexity with more data (e.g., k-Nearest Neighbors).

Feature Importance: What is feature importance and how can it be determined?

It refers to techniques for scoring how valuable each input feature is in predicting the target. Methods include model-based scores (from decision trees), permutation importance, and SHAP values.

Generative vs. Discriminative Models: What is the difference?

Discriminative models learn the decision boundary between classes (estimating P(y|x)).

Generative models learn the joint distribution of data and labels (P(x, y)) and can be used to generate new data instances.

Ensemble Learning: Why and how are ensemble methods used?

Ensembles combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

Bagging (e.g., Random Forest) reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different data subsets.

Boosting (e.g., XGBoost) reduces bias by sequentially training models that focus on the errors of previous ones.

Reinforcement Learning Basics: What is reinforcement learning?

An agent learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions, aiming to maximize cumulative reward. It learns from trial-and-error feedback over time, balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions).

Imbalanced Data Handling: How do you handle imbalanced datasets?

Techniques include resampling (oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority), using class-weighted loss functions, and choosing appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., ROC AUC, F1-score) over accuracy.

Cross-Validation Strategies: Which cross-validation technique would you use for a time-series dataset?

For time-series data, use time-aware CV methods like rolling forward chaining (or time-series split), which train on past data and validate on future data to respect temporal order.

Regularization: What is regularization and why is it important?

Regularization techniques (like L1 and L2 penalties) add a penalty for large model weights to the loss function. This discourages overly complex models and helps prevent overfitting.

Hyperparameter Tuning: How would you approach hyperparameter tuning?

Use methods like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization. Evaluate combinations using a validation set or cross-validation. Consider computational cost and use tools like Optuna or Hyperopt for automation.

Coding & Algorithmic Challenges

Implementing ML Algorithms: Describe how you would implement logistic regression from scratch.

Outline the steps: initialize weights, define the sigmoid function and logistic loss function, and iterate using gradient descent to update weights until convergence. Discuss vectorization for efficiency.

Data Structures for ML: Design a data structure for efficient nearest neighbor search in high dimensions.

Explain algorithms like KD-trees (for lower dimensions) or approximate methods like Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) or Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs, which are used in vector databases.

Matrix Operations: Write a function to compute the cosine similarity between two vectors.

The implementation should calculate the dot product of the two vectors and divide it by the product of their magnitudes.

Generated python
import numpy as np

def cosine_similarity(v1, v2):
    dot_product = np.dot(v1, v2)
    norm_v1 = np.linalg.norm(v1)
    norm_v2 = np.linalg.norm(v2)
    return dot_product / (norm_v1 * norm_v2)


Neural Network Forward Pass: Implement the forward pass of a single-layer neural network.

The candidate should translate the equation output = activation(W · X + b) into code for a given activation function like sigmoid or ReLU.

Algorithmic Problem (General): Solve a classic coding problem like finding the shortest path in a graph.

A senior ML engineer is expected to have solid CS fundamentals. Explain Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs.

System Design & Applied Machine Learning

End-to-End ML Pipeline Design: Design an end-to-end pipeline for predicting housing prices.

Describe the stages: data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring. Emphasize automation and reproducibility.

Real-Time Predictions: Design a system to provide real-time predictions to millions of users.

Discuss a scalable architecture: a model deployed behind a REST/gRPC API, load balancers, a caching layer, and potential use of model compression or hardware accelerators for low latency.

Feature Engineering at Scale: How would you engineer features and train a model on a dataset too large for a single machine?

Mention distributed data processing (Spark, Dask), distributed training frameworks (Horovod, parameter servers), and cloud-based big data tools.

A/B Testing for Models: How would you design an experiment to compare a new ML model to a production model?

Explain A/B testing: serve a percentage of traffic to the new model, collect performance and business metrics, and use statistical analysis to determine if the new model is a significant improvement.

Recommender System Design: Outline the design of a recommendation engine for an e-commerce platform.

Discuss collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. Cover data requirements (user logs, item metadata), model training (matrix factorization or deep learning embeddings), and serving with low latency.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Conceptual & Theoretical Questions

Text Preprocessing: What are common text preprocessing steps?

Tokenization, stop-word removal, lowercasing, and stemming/lemmatization. These steps clean and normalize text to reduce vocabulary size and improve model performance.

Syntactic vs. Semantic Analysis: What's the difference?

Syntactic analysis (parsing) deals with the grammatical structure of sentences.

Semantic analysis is about understanding the meaning, context, and intent of the text.

Stemming vs. Lemmatization: What are they?

Both reduce words to a base form. Stemming is a crude, rule-based process that chops off suffixes (e.g., "changing" → "chang"). Lemmatization is a more advanced, dictionary-based process that returns the root form (lemma) of a word (e.g., "changing" → "change").

Word Embeddings: What are they and why are they useful?

Word embeddings are dense vector representations of words where semantically similar words are close in the vector space. They allow algorithms to work with text numerically while capturing meaning, which improves performance on downstream tasks.

Bag-of-Words vs. Embeddings: Compare Bag-of-Words with word embeddings.

Bag-of-Words (BoW) represents text by word counts in a sparse vector, ignoring word order.

Embeddings (like Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) represent words in a dense, low-dimensional vector space, capturing semantic relationships and context.

Transformer Architecture: How did Transformers revolutionize NLP?

Transformers introduced the self-attention mechanism, allowing models to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence simultaneously. This enabled parallel processing of sequences and capturing long-range dependencies, leading to the development of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs).

Attention Mechanism: Explain the concept of "attention" in NLP models.

Attention allows a model to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when producing an output. In self-attention (used in Transformers), each word's representation is updated by attending to all other words in the same sequence.

BERT vs. GPT: What are the key differences between BERT and GPT?

This is a classic question. The main differences lie in their architecture, training objective, and primary use cases.

Aspect	BERT (Google)	GPT (OpenAI)
Architecture	Transformer Encoder (bidirectional)	Transformer Decoder (autoregressive, unidirectional)
Training Objective	Masked Language Model (MLM)	Next-Word Prediction
Context	Bidirectional (sees words to the left and right)	Unidirectional (sees only words to the left)
Primary Use Cases	Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks like classification, NER, Q&A.	Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks like text creation, chatbots.
Output	Contextual embeddings for input text.	Generates new, fluent text.

Sequence-to-Sequence Models: How do encoder-decoder models work?

An encoder network processes the source sequence into a context representation. A decoder network then generates the target sequence token by token, often using an attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the encoded input.

Language Model Evaluation: How do you measure the performance of a language model?

Perplexity (lower is better) measures how well a model predicts a sample.

For downstream tasks, use task-specific metrics: BLEU for translation, ROUGE for summarization, and accuracy/F1 for classification. Human evaluation is also crucial for assessing quality.

Coding Challenges

Tokenization Script: Write a simple function to tokenize a sentence.

A function that takes a string and splits it into a list of words, handling basic punctuation and whitespace. Regex can be used for more robust tokenization.

TF-IDF Computation: Outline code to compute TF-IDF vectors.

Explain the steps: calculate Term Frequency (TF), then Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), and multiply them. Mention using scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer but also be able to explain the manual calculation.

Anagram Detection: Write a function to detect if two strings are anagrams.

A classic string manipulation problem. Solutions involve sorting the strings or using a hash map to count character frequencies.

Parsing and Data Extraction: Given structured text, write a parser to extract specific information.

This tests programmatic text handling, such as using regex or string splitting to parse a log file or a formatted string.

Handling OOV Words: How do modern NLP models handle out-of-vocabulary words?

Discuss subword tokenization techniques like Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece, which break unknown words into known subword units. This allows the model to process any text without a fixed vocabulary.

System Design & Applied NLP

Search Engine Design: How would you design a search engine for a support knowledge base?

Discuss indexing documents (e.g., BM25 for keyword search, or vector embeddings for semantic search). Cover the retrieval component, the ranking component, and query understanding (e.g., spelling correction).

Text Classification Pipeline: Design a pipeline for sentiment analysis of product reviews.

Cover data collection, labeling, preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF vs. embeddings), model selection (e.g., fine-tuning BERT vs. simpler models), deployment via an API, and monitoring for drift.

Machine Translation System: What components are needed to build a machine translation system?

Discuss the need for parallel corpora, a sequence-to-sequence model (likely a Transformer), an inference strategy like beam search, and evaluation with BLEU scores. Mention subword tokenization for handling rare words.

Conversational Bot Design: Outline the design of a Q&A chatbot for internal documentation.

Propose a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. The system would first retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base (using vector search) and then use an LLM to generate a natural language answer based on the retrieved context.

Generative AI (LLMs, Diffusion Models & GANs)
Conceptual & Theoretical Questions

GAN Fundamentals: Explain the core principles of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

A GAN consists of two competing neural networks: a generator that creates fake data and a discriminator that tries to distinguish fake data from real data. They are trained in a minimax game until the generator produces realistic outputs.

Mode Collapse in GANs: What is "mode collapse" and how can it be mitigated?

Mode collapse is when a GAN's generator learns to produce only a few types of outputs, failing to capture the full diversity of the data distribution. Mitigation strategies include using different loss functions (e.g., Wasserstein GAN) or architectural changes like minibatch discrimination.

Latent Space: What is a "latent space" in generative models?

The latent space is an abstract, multi-dimensional space that a generative model samples from to create data. Points in this space represent compressed features of the data, and moving through the space can lead to predictable changes in the generated output.

Variational Autoencoders (VAE): How does a VAE work?

A VAE is an autoencoder where the encoder maps an input to a probability distribution (typically a Gaussian) in the latent space. A vector is then sampled from this distribution and passed to the decoder. The training objective includes a reconstruction loss and a regularization term (KL-divergence) that ensures a smooth, well-structured latent space.

VAE vs. GAN: Compare VAEs and GANs.

VAEs are likelihood-based models that are stable to train but often produce slightly blurrier outputs.

GANs are trained adversarially, often producing sharper, more realistic outputs but can be unstable to train and suffer from mode collapse.

Diffusion Models: Explain the concept of diffusion models.

Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a gradual noising process. They start with random noise and iteratively denoise it over many steps to produce a clean sample. They are known for generating very high-quality outputs (e.g., DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion) but are computationally intensive and slow at inference time.

Large Language Models (LLMs): What factors enabled their recent success?

Scale: Massive amounts of data and model parameters.

Architecture: The highly parallelizable Transformer architecture.

Compute: Advances in hardware (GPUs/TPUs) and distributed training techniques.

Self-Supervised Learning: Training on vast unlabeled text corpora.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): How is RLHF used to fine-tune LLMs?

RLHF aligns LLMs with human preferences. The process involves:

Collecting human feedback (e.g., ranking model outputs).

Training a reward model to predict human preferences.

Fine-tuning the LLM using reinforcement learning (e.g., PPO) to maximize the score from the reward model. This makes the model more helpful and harmless.

Evaluating Generative Models: How do you evaluate the quality of generative models?

Images: Inception Score (IS) and Fréchet Inception Distance (FID).

Text: Perplexity, BLEU/ROUGE for specific tasks, and human evaluation for coherence, relevance, and factuality.

Ethical Considerations: What are the ethical issues associated with generative AI?

Key issues include deepfakes and misinformation, amplification of biases present in training data, and copyright/IP concerns. Mitigations involve data filtering, content moderation, model watermarking, and clear usage policies.

Coding & Implementation Challenges

Sampling from an LLM: Write pseudo-code to generate text using top-k sampling.

Outline a loop where at each step, you get the model's probability distribution over the vocabulary, select the top k most likely tokens, re-normalize their probabilities, and sample from that reduced set.

Beam Search Implementation: Implement a simple beam search in pseudo-code.

Describe how to maintain a "beam" of the B most likely partial sequences at each step. For each sequence in the beam, generate next-token possibilities, calculate cumulative scores, and keep only the top B new sequences for the next step.

GAN Training Loop: Outline the training algorithm for a GAN.

Generated python
# Pseudo-code for one training iteration
for _ in range(discriminator_steps):
    # 1. Train Discriminator
    real_samples = get_real_data_batch()
    fake_samples = generator(generate_noise())
    d_loss_real = discriminator_loss(discriminator(real_samples), real_label)
    d_loss_fake = discriminator_loss(discriminator(fake_samples.detach()), fake_label)
    d_loss = d_loss_real + d_loss_fake
    d_loss.backward()
    discriminator_optimizer.step()

# 2. Train Generator
fake_samples = generator(generate_noise())
# We want the discriminator to think these are real
g_loss = generator_loss(discriminator(fake_samples), real_label)
g_loss.backward()
generator_optimizer.step()

System Design & Applied Generative AI

LLM-powered Application Architecture: Design a system like ChatGPT.

Key components:

Model Hosting: Scalable GPU servers, possibly with model sharding.

Inference Optimization: Batching, quantization, and caching.

Context Management: Handling conversation history within the model's context limit.

Safety & Moderation: Input/output content filters.

Monitoring: Tracking latency, cost, and response quality.

Customized Content Generation: Design a system to create personalized news summaries.

Propose a two-step approach:

Retrieval: Fetch relevant news articles based on user profile/interests.

Generation: Use an LLM to synthesize a personalized summary from the retrieved content, grounded in facts to ensure accuracy.

Fine-tuning vs. Prompting Decision: How do you decide between fine-tuning and prompt engineering for a specific task?

Fine-tuning: Better for highly specialized domains, but requires data, compute, and maintenance of a custom model.

Prompt Engineering (with few-shot examples): Faster and cheaper if the task is within the pre-trained model's capabilities.

The decision depends on performance requirements, data availability, budget, and operational complexity.

Safety in Generative AI Deployment: What safeguards would you put in place for a customer-facing generative AI model?

Content filtering, rate limiting, human-in-the-loop for high-stakes use cases, clear disclaimers that content is AI-generated, and robust monitoring for misuse or harmful outputs.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Conceptual Questions

RAG Fundamentals: What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation and why is it used?

RAG combines a retrieval system (like a vector database) with a generative LLM. It first fetches relevant information from a knowledge source and then provides that information as context to the LLM to generate an answer. This helps reduce hallucinations, allows the model to use up-to-date or domain-specific information, and provides source citations.

Vector Databases: What is a vector database and what is its role in RAG?

A vector database is purpose-built to store and query high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) efficiently. In RAG, it stores embeddings of documents or knowledge chunks and enables fast semantic search to find information relevant to a user's query.

RAG vs. Long Context LLMs: Why use RAG instead of just an LLM with a very long context window?

RAG is often more efficient and scalable. It pinpoints relevant information instead of forcing the model to process a massive, dense context. It also allows knowledge to be updated in real-time by just updating the vector database, whereas a long-context model's knowledge is static until it's retrained.

Key Components of a RAG Pipeline: What are the typical components?

Document Store / Knowledge Base: Where the source information is stored (e.g., a vector DB).

Retriever: The component that fetches relevant documents (e.g., using vector similarity search).

Reranker (Optional): A model that refines the retrieved documents for relevance.

Generative Model (LLM): The model that synthesizes the final answer using the query and retrieved context.

Handling Incorrect Retrievals: How can a RAG system mitigate irrelevant retrievals?

Use a reranker to improve the quality of retrieved documents. Retrieve a larger number of documents and let the LLM decide which are most relevant. Implement a feedback loop to improve retrieval over time.

RAG vs. Fine-tuning: When would you use RAG versus fine-tuning for a domain-specific Q&A task?

RAG is ideal for knowledge-intensive tasks where facts can change or the knowledge base is large. It's flexible and easy to update.

Fine-tuning is better for teaching the model a new skill, style, or format. It embeds the knowledge into the model's weights.

Often, a hybrid approach (fine-tuning a model for a task and then using it in a RAG pipeline) works best.

Practical & Coding-Oriented Questions

Vector Search Algorithm: Explain how Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search works.

ANN algorithms trade perfect accuracy for immense speed. Methods like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) or LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing) build index structures that allow for sub-linear time search, making it feasible to search billions of vectors in milliseconds.

Embedding Generation Code: How would you populate a vector database with documents?

Outline the steps:

Chunking: Break large documents into smaller, meaningful chunks (e.g., paragraphs).

Embedding: Use a pre-trained embedding model (e.g., Sentence-BERT) to convert each chunk into a vector.

Upserting: Load the vectors and their associated metadata (like document ID and original text) into the vector database.

RAG Pipeline Flow: Walk through the pseudo-code of a RAG system.

Generated python
def answer_query(query: str):
    # 1. Embed the query
    query_embedding = embedding_model.encode(query)

    # 2. Retrieve relevant context
    retrieved_chunks = vector_db.search(query_embedding, top_k=5)

    # 3. Construct the prompt
    context_str = "\n".join([chunk.text for chunk in retrieved_chunks])
    prompt = f"Based on the following context, answer the user's query.\n\nContext:\n{context_str}\n\nQuery: {query}\n\nAnswer:"

    # 4. Generate the answer
    answer = llm.generate(prompt)
    return answer

System Design & Architecture Questions

Scalable RAG Architecture: Design a RAG architecture for millions of enterprise documents.

Key considerations:

A scalable, managed vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate).

A separate, auto-scaling service for the retriever and the LLM.

A robust data ingestion pipeline to keep the index up-to-date.

Security: Implement access control to ensure users can only retrieve information from documents they are authorized to see.

Hybrid Search: What is hybrid retrieval in RAG and why is it useful?

Hybrid search combines keyword-based (lexical) search (like BM25) with vector (semantic) search. It's useful because it provides the best of both worlds: lexical search excels at finding exact matches for rare keywords or acronyms, while semantic search is great at finding conceptually related information.

RAG Architecture Variants: Compare different RAG architectures.

RAG Architecture	Key Idea & Features
Naïve RAG	Retrieve top-k documents and concatenate them with the query for the LLM. Simple but can be misled by irrelevant context.
RAG with Reranking	Retrieve a larger set of candidates, then use a lightweight model to re-rank them for relevance before passing the best ones to the LLM. Improves precision.
Hybrid RAG	Combines vector search with other methods like keyword search or knowledge graph traversal to provide richer, more accurate context.
Agentic RAG	Uses an LLM-based "agent" that can perform multi-step reasoning, issue multiple queries, or use different tools (e.g., vector search, web search) to gather information before synthesizing an answer.
MLOps, Deployment & Infrastructure
Deployment & Monitoring Questions

MLOps vs DevOps: What is MLOps and how is it different from DevOps?

MLOps applies DevOps principles to ML systems. It extends DevOps by adding practices for managing data, experiments, and models. Key differences include the need for data and model versioning, continuous training (CT), and monitoring for model-specific issues like concept drift.

Model/Concept Drift: What is model drift and how do you detect it?

Concept drift is when the statistical properties of the target variable or the relationship between features and the target change over time, causing model performance to degrade. It can be detected by monitoring model performance metrics (e.g., accuracy) and the statistical distributions of input features and predictions over time.

Pre-Deployment Testing: What testing is done before deploying an ML model?

Unit tests for data processing code.

Integration tests for the entire pipeline.

Model performance validation on a hold-out test set.

Stress/Load testing to ensure the serving infrastructure can handle production traffic.

Shadow deployment or A/B testing to compare against the existing model on live data.

Model Versioning: Why is versioning important for models and data in MLOps?

Versioning ensures reproducibility, traceability, and reliable rollbacks. It allows you to tie a specific prediction back to the exact model, code, and data version used, which is critical for debugging, auditing, and governance.

CI/CD for ML: How would you implement a CI/CD pipeline for ML?

Continuous Integration (CI): Automate testing of data processing and model training code.

Continuous Training (CT): Automate the process of retraining the model on new data.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Automate the deployment of a validated model to production, often packaged in a container.

The pipeline should include quality gates based on model performance metrics.

Model Packaging and Serving: What are common ways to package and deploy a model?

REST API: Wrap the model in a web service (e.g., using FastAPI/Flask), containerize it with Docker, and deploy on Kubernetes or a cloud platform.

Serverless: Deploy as a function on services like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions for event-driven workloads.

Batch Processing: Use the model in a scheduled job (e.g., a Spark job) for offline inference.

Edge Deployment: Export the model to a lightweight format (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow Lite) for on-device inference.

Infrastructure for Scale: How do you scale model inference to handle high throughput?

Horizontal Scaling: Replicate the service across multiple machines/containers with a load balancer.

Model Optimization: Use techniques like quantization, pruning, or knowledge distillation to create smaller, faster models.

Hardware Acceleration: Utilize GPUs or specialized chips (e.g., TPUs).

Batching: Group multiple inference requests together to process them in a single forward pass, which significantly increases throughput.

Monitoring in Production: What metrics would you monitor for a deployed ML system?

Operational Metrics: Latency, throughput, error rate, CPU/GPU utilization.

Model Performance Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE, etc., on live data (if ground truth is available).

Data Drift Metrics: Statistical distance (e.g., KL divergence) between the distribution of live data and the training data.

Prediction Drift: Changes in the distribution of the model's output.

Retraining Triggers: When and how would you decide to retrain a model?

Scheduled Retraining: Retrain at a fixed interval (e.g., daily, weekly).

Performance-based Retraining: Trigger retraining when model performance drops below a certain threshold.

Drift-based Retraining: Trigger retraining when significant data or concept drift is detected.

The process should be automated via a CT pipeline.

A/B Testing Deployment Strategy: Describe how to safely deploy a new model version.

Use a canary release by initially routing a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 1%) to the new model. Monitor its performance and operational metrics closely. If it performs well, gradually increase the traffic until it handles 100%. Have a rollback plan ready to quickly revert to the old model if issues arise.

Security & Privacy in ML: What are security concerns for deployed ML models?

Data Privacy: Protecting sensitive user data used for training and inference (e.g., PII anonymization).

Adversarial Attacks: Maliciously crafted inputs designed to fool the model.

Model Inversion/Extraction: Attacks that aim to steal the model or reconstruct its training data.

Mitigations include input validation, rate limiting, differential privacy, and regular security audits of the serving infrastructure.
